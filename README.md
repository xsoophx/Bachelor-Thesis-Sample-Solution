# Bachelor's Thesis sample solution

This project is providing a sample solution for the task, which was supposed to be solved in the practical part of my
Bachelor's Thesis.

The values for the A* Algorithm were taken
from the german [wikipedia entry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*-Algorithmus#Anwendungsgebiete) of the A* algorithm.

Unfortunately, there were two small errors in the distances of the place nodes in the corresponding JSON.
I'll check the algorithms in the solutions for their correctness.
